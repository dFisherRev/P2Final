Jack Black's Blackjack

Project Discription:
  This program is a typical blackjack table game. Once signing in, the player can view their account info, and change if they need to, or head right into a game of blackjack!
  The game opens with a betting screen where a player can bet chips, or they can leave the pot empty if practice is desired. Once clicking the deal button, cards are distributed 
  to the player and dealer with one card from dealer showing, as is typical. The player can press the hit button to recieve a new card, or, when desired, hit stay to lock in 
  their cards.
